## Join the pyOpenSci Editorial Board
Thanks to the efforts of our incredible team of volunteers, pyOpenSci is growing! As a result, we're currently seeing a large number of package submissions to [our open peer review process](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html). In order to continue supporting scientists in the development of open source scientific software, we're looking to add volunteers to our Editorial Board.

The pyOpenSci Editorial Board is comprised of a diverse group of volunteers, with each editor being responsible for the following tasks:

* Finding reviewers from diverse backgrounds who have a mixture of scientific domain and Python experience.
* Overseeing the entire review process for a package ensuring it runs in a timely and efficient manner.
* Supporting the submitting authors and reviewers in answering questions related to the review.
* Determining whether that package should be accepted into the pyOpenSci ecosystem once the review has wrapped up.

It's critical to our mission that our Editorial Board have a combined expertise in various scientific domains, technical expertise in Python packaging, awareness of the importance of documentation in package usability, and awareness of the importance of CI/test suites in order to ensure robust software development. We do not expect any single editor to be an expert in all of these areas!

### Guest and Full editors
pyOpenSci has two primary types of editors: guest and full. Both types of editors are considered a part of the editorial board for pyOpenSci. The major difference between guest and full editors is that a guest editor may only join the board for a single review, and may be new to pyOpenSci’s review process and thus require a bit more support in their first review.

In addition, a new editor will be considered “guest” for the first 3 months of their tenure and/or until they have completed their first review. Once they have a completed a review they can be considered to be a full editor as deemed appropriate by the software review lead and the current editorial board.

#### Guest editors
A guest editor is is invited to lead a review in the case where we need specific expertise for a single review. We also consider editors who are performing their first review as guest editors as they may require more guidance or mentorship to complete the review (if they are new to our organization).

New editors who wish to continue on as full editors for pyOpenSci may do so as long as both parties (pyOpenSci and the guest editors) feel like it is a healthy fit for them and the organization.

#### Full editors
A full editor is most often someone who has experience with the pyOpenSci open package review process. A full editor ideally has completed a review for at least 1 package for pyOpenSci, and/or has submitted and gone through the pyOpenSci package review process, and/or has experience reviewing for an organization such as JOSS or rOpenSci.

We also appreciate when editors have experience working with or in the Python open source software community be it maintaining packages, contributing to packages, or supporting the community. This is certainly not a requirement however if you are interested in getting involved with pyOpenSci!

### Apply to be a pyOpenSci editor
We're currently looking for editors from a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, with a current focus on climatology and energy.
