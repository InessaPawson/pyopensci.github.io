## <i class="fa-regular fa-heart"></i> The pyOpenSci mission
Founded in 2018 by our Executive Director, [Leah Wasser](https://github.com/lwasser), pyOpenSci builds diverse community that supports free and open Python tools for processing scientific data. We also build technical skills needed to contribute to open source and that support open science. While a diverse, inclusive community is at our core, radiating out from it are the three petals–how we accomplish our community goals–of pyOpenSci. These are:

1. Open peer review of scientific software
2. Community partnerships
3. Training and open educational resources

A great primer for all things pyOpenSci is our [pyOpenSci lightning talk template [currently WIP]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1205l8y75SI9spdklKnxDZzwwjArHvpeIpwFGZOvVLjc/edit?usp=sharing).


## <i class="fa-solid fa-bullhorn"></i> Promote pyOpenSci online and in-person
pyOpenSci is active on both LinkedIn and Fosstodon, and you’re welcome to tag us as well as reach out with questions! We also have a series of brand assets and guidelines if you need a copy of our logo, information on our fonts, and/or access to various illustrations we use.

Dependent on timing, cost, and location, we’d also be more than happy to send you a set of pyOpenSci stickers to share! Please reach out to media@pyopensci.org to inquire about your event.
Please feel free to use any information from the “What is pyOpenSci?” section above, as well as information on our website and our [pyOpenSci lightning talk template], to share about the work pyOpenSci is doing. And don’t forget to share your personal experiences with pyOpenSci as well!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-chevron-down"></i> Submit a package to pyOpenSci
pyOpenSci reviews higher level software packages that support scientific workflows.

The mission of pyOpenSci’s open peer review process is to:

Support improving the quality, usability and discoverability of maintained scientific Python software in support of open science.

We also support maintainers in navigating the Python packaging ecosystem.

We do not operate like a Journal, but we do partner with the Journal of Open Source software for those who wish to obtain a Journal paper through our review.
