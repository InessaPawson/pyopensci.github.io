We're growing out editorial team, and are seeking volunteers from a wide variety of scientific backgrounds.

If you're looking to give back to the broader Python community, consider joining our Editorial Board! The pyOpenSci Editorial Board is comprised of a diverse group of volunteer editors, each one responsible for the following tasks:

* Finding reviewers from diverse backgrounds who have a mixture of scientific domain and Python experience.
* Overseeing the entire review process for a package ensuring it runs in a timely and efficient manner.
* Supporting the submitting authors and reviewers in answering questions related to the review.
* Determining whether that package should be accepted into the pyOpenSci ecosystem once the review has wrapped up.

While we have a current need for editors with expertise in climatology and/or energy, we're also recruiting editors from all scientific disciplines. If you feel you'd be a good fit for the pyOpenSci Editorial Board, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRQHQ7NKVEAG3BKAphiUdVFvQ5nkez0IpyXBMZDzXjuBPloQ/viewform).

If you're interested in joining our Editorial Board, but have questions or would like to chat with someone from pyOpenSci about volunteering to be an editor, please email us at [media@pyopensci.org](mailto:media@pyopensci.org).
