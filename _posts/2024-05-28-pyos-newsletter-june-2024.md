## <i class="fa-regular fa-comments"></i> PyCon was incredible!


## <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-simple"></i> See you at SciPy
[SciPy 2024](https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/) is just around the corner, and we can't wait to see you there! We're pulling together our pyOpenSci Guide to SciPy, similar to the guide we did for [PyCon 2024](https://www.pyopensci.org/blog/pyos-guide-to-pyconus-2024.html), and wanted to give you a preview of some of the tutorials and talks being given by pyOpenSci Community members!

### Tutorials
#### [3D Visualization with PyVista](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/talk/GKGRWE/)
Led by [Tetsuo Koyama](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/speaker/WY7NA9/), [Alexander Kaszynski](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/speaker/3RXHG8/), [Bill Little](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/speaker/FDVWDN/), and [Bane Sullivan](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/speaker/NEC33M/), this tutorial demonstrates [PyVista's](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista) latest capabilities and bring a wide range of users to the forefront of 3D visualization in Python, including:

* Use PyVista to create 3D visualizations from a variety of datasets in common formats.
* Overview the classes and data structures of PyVista with real-world examples.
* Be familiar of the various filters and features of PyVista.
* Know which Python libraries are used and can be used by PyVista (meshio, trimesh etc).
* We see this tutorial catering to anyone who wants to visualize data in any domain, and this ranges from basic Python users to advanced power users.

#### [Create Your First Python Package: Make Your Python Code Easier to Share and Use](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/talk/QT9GBY/)
Led by pyOpenSci's Executive Director and Founder, [Leah Wasser](https://github.com/lwasser), in this tutorial session you'll learn how to:

* Create code that can be installed into different environments
* Use [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) as a workflow tool, making setup and installation of your code easier
* Use Hatch to publish your package to (test) PyPI

### Talks
#### [The power of community in solving scientific Python’s most challenging problems](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/talk/AMTLJ7/)
This talk from our Executive Director and Founder, [Leah Wasser](https://github.com/lwasser), shares pyOpenSci’s knowledge in building a constructive open peer review process that supports maintainers, and also resources that make Python packaging more accessible and easier-to-navigate. Our insights are based on five years of experience working with over 200 community members, who have evaluated 58 packages developed by over 56 package maintainers.

#### [Great Tables for Everyone](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/talk/BRMQRW/)
This talk from [Rich Iannone](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/speaker/NJCPZ7/) will provide a demonstration of Great Tables, showing how data can come alive in when in tabular form. We’ll use data from the fields of meteorology, chemistry, and the atmospheric sciences within our table-making examples. We’ll learn how the different components of a table (e.g., the column labels, the header, etc.) can be manipulated to best convey the data. We believe tables are worthy of being deemed data visualizations and we hope that Great Tables can become an indispensable tool in your data analysis workflow.

#### [From Code to Clarity: Using Quarto for Python Documentation](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/talk/GFGSTS/)
[Isabel Zimmerman](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/speaker/AVSVUJ/) will be speaking from her experiences as an open source developer who works with multilingual tools, and how Quarto + quartodoc helped to fill those gaps. This talk is intended for anyone who might have to communicate with stakeholders through code using a web-based format. She'll be focusing on Python package documentation websites, but the stories and examples expose the difficulties in many types of technical communication. The intent is to have a lighthearted talk filled with examples of how to make technical communication and publishing easier and more accessible.

We love a good get-together, and our Open Source Fall Festival is no exception! Held entirely online using [Gather](https://www.gather.town/), our goals is to bring together members of the Python community that create open source tools with the members of the Python community who use the tools. In building this festival, our focus is on a grassroots, community-led event with some big unconference vibes. So mark your calendars, and save the date for September 28--29th, 2024!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-holding-heart"></i> Python packages for everyone!
pyOpenSci's [Open Peer Review process](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html) is experiencing an [unprecedented number of Python package submissions](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues!) We're excited to see so many wonderful packages that are helping scientists help make the world a better place being submitted for review. Our open peer review process facilitates scientists getting credit and recognition for the work they’ve invested in developing scientific Python tools. The peer review process also supports scientists in finding vetted and maintained software, which drives their open science workflows.

You can submit your package for review (or pre-submission inquiry to determine if it's in scope) by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues/new/choose) to [our software-submission repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission). And because all of our reviews are open, [you can see our review process in action](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission).

We're also accepting applications for [package reviewers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVf-L_1-jYeO84OvEE8UemEoCmIiD5ddP_aO8S90vb7srADQ/viewform). We welcome reviewers from a diversity of background and with varying levels of Python technical expertise.

Some of the basic things that we look for in a review include:
* Familiarity with using the Python programming language.
* Ability to evaluate a Python package for usability and documentation quality.
* Ability to provide a technical review of Python package structure and code quality / approach to solving the problems that the package seeks to address.

We like to have a mix of technical and usability focus in our reviews so it’s ok if you don’t have all of the above skills!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-bullhorn"></i> Get involved with pyOpenSci: call for editors

If you're looking to give back to the broader Python community, consider joining our Editorial Board! The pyOpenSci Editorial Board is comprised of a diverse group of volunteer editors, each one responsible for the following tasks:

* Finding reviewers from diverse backgrounds who have a mixture of scientific domain and Python experience.
* Overseeing the entire review process for a package ensuring it runs in a timely and efficient manner.
* Supporting the submitting authors and reviewers in answering questions related to the review.
* Determining whether that package should be accepted into the pyOpenSci ecosystem once the review has wrapped up.

While we have a current need for editors with expertise in climatology and/or energy, we're also recruiting editors from all scientific disciplines. If you feel you'd be a good fit for the pyOpenSci Editorial Board, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRQHQ7NKVEAG3BKAphiUdVFvQ5nkez0IpyXBMZDzXjuBPloQ/viewform).
