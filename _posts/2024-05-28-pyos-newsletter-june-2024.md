We love a good get-together, and our Open Source Fall Festival is no exception! Held entirely online using [Gather](https://www.gather.town/), our goals is to bring together members of the Python community that create open source tools with the members of the Python community who use the tools. In building this festival, our focus is on a grassroots, community-led event with some big unconference vibes. So mark your calendars, and save the date for September 28--29th, 2024!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-holding-heart"></i> Python packages for everyone!
pyOpenSci's [Open Peer Review process](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html) is experiencing an [unprecedented number of Python package submissions](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues!) We're excited to see so many wonderful packages that are helping scientists help make the world a better place being submitted for review. Our open peer review process facilitates scientists getting credit and recognition for the work they’ve invested in developing scientific Python tools. The peer review process also supports scientists in finding vetted and maintained software, which drives their open science workflows.

You can submit your package for review (or pre-submission inquiry to determine if it's in scope) by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission/issues/new/choose) to [our software-submission repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission). And because all of our reviews are open, [you can see our review process in action](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-submission).

We're also accepting applications for [package reviewers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVf-L_1-jYeO84OvEE8UemEoCmIiD5ddP_aO8S90vb7srADQ/viewform). We welcome reviewers from a diversity of background and with varying levels of Python technical expertise.

Some of the basic things that we look for in a review include:
* Familiarity with using the Python programming language.
* Ability to evaluate a Python package for usability and documentation quality.
* Ability to provide a technical review of Python package structure and code quality / approach to solving the problems that the package seeks to address.

We like to have a mix of technical and usability focus in our reviews so it’s ok if you don’t have all of the above skills!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-bullhorn"></i> Get involved with pyOpenSci: call for editors

    <img src="/images/blog/2024/may/pyos-call-for-editors.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Off-white square on a purple floral background with text that reads: Get involved with pyOpenSci! We're growing out editorial team, and are seeking volunteers from a wide variety of scientific backgrounds. Editors: lead the review process for 3-4 packages a year and assist with editorial and peer review policies. People from diverse backgrounds are especially encouraged to apply! Questions? Email media@pyopensci.org. Apply: bit.ly/pyOSEditor">
    </a>

If you're looking to give back to the broader Python community, consider joining our Editorial Board! The pyOpenSci Editorial Board is comprised of a diverse group of volunteer editors, each one responsible for the following tasks:

* Finding reviewers from diverse backgrounds who have a mixture of scientific domain and Python experience.
* Overseeing the entire review process for a package ensuring it runs in a timely and efficient manner.
* Supporting the submitting authors and reviewers in answering questions related to the review.
* Determining whether that package should be accepted into the pyOpenSci ecosystem once the review has wrapped up.

While we have a current need for editors with expertise in climatology and/or energy, we're also recruiting editors from all scientific disciplines. If you feel you'd be a good fit for the pyOpenSci Editorial Board, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRQHQ7NKVEAG3BKAphiUdVFvQ5nkez0IpyXBMZDzXjuBPloQ/viewform).

If you're interested in joining our Editorial Board, but have questions or would like to chat with someone from pyOpenSci about volunteering to be an editor, please email us at [media@pyopensci.org](mailto:media@pyopensci.org).
